# WORK IN PROGRESS - Intel® Optimized Cloud Recipes (OCRs)

© Copyright 2022, Intel Corporation

## Overview

Intel® Optimized Cloud Recipes (OCRs) are a combination of documentation(markdown) and scripted automation that enables and optimizes technologies on Intel® Architecture (IA).

The goal of the OCRs is to provide a simple and easy way to enable and optimize technologies on Intel® Architecture (IA).
These scripts can be use by Intel cloud optimization modules for HashiCorp Terraform via Cloud_Init integration or directly on their own.

The scripts are are usually written in Ansible or PowerShell and are meant to automate operating system and above configuration.

Some example of technologies that can be enabled and optimized are:

- AI Training and Inference with Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX)
- Encryption/Decryption with Intel Quick Assist Technology (Intel QAT)
- MySQL Open Source Database
- PostgreSQL Open Source Database
