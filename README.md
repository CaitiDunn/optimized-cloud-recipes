# WORK IN PROGRESS - Intel® Optimized Cloud Recipes (OCRs)

© Copyright 2023, Intel Corporation

## Overview

Intel® Optimized Cloud Recipes (OCRs) are:

1. A combination of documentation(markdown) and scripted automation developed to enables/optimizes technologies on Intel® Architecture (IA)
2. Currently focused on enabling Infrastructure-as-a-Service(IaaS) Virtual Machines(VMs) on public cloud providers
3. Written in Ansible or PowerShell and are meant to automate operating system and above configuration
4. Ready be use by Intel cloud optimization modules for HashiCorp Terraform via Cloud_Init integration or directly on their own

Some example of technologies that can be enabled and optimized are:

- AI Training and Inference with Intel® Advanced Matrix Extensions (Intel® AMX)
- Encryption/Decryption with Intel Quick Assist Technology (Intel QAT)
- MySQL Open Source Database
- PostgreSQL Open Source Database

### How to use it

Recipes are located in the `recipes` folder. Each recipe has its own folder and contains a `README.md` file with instructions on how to use it.
